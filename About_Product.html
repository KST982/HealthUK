<p class = "main_text"> The HealthDot is a new product that will allow users to measure all their body vitals and monitor them from their smartphone or other smart device (like the Amazon Alexa). What makes this product unique is that it has the ability to measure blood sugar levels directly through state-of-the-art skin sensors that can measure sugar levels using small microwaves. It also has the ability to collate information from other smart fitness/health systems such as smart watches, bracelets etc. using a special module that can collect the information and store it in one place so that the user only requires one app/area to access all their information relating to the body vitals. The product will be able to track information such as heart rate (using the ECG), skin temperature (using the thermistor), blood sugar levels (using CGM – continuous glucose monitoring), step counting (using gyroscopes and tracking sensors) and patterns developing during sleep (REM counting). This information is then sent to the user’s smartphone through Bluetooth to allow real-time monitoring. This product idea is different to anything available on the market as this device contains all the important features an individual would use and want, in one whole package. This product is also more likely to appeal to the younger target audience due to its modern style and the use of highly specialised technologies. There is currently no other smart device available that offers these features/technologies at a competitive price point. Our product uses a variety of sophisticated technology that allows you to meaure different vitals in your body (at ease, of course!). We wanted to make this product as technically advanced as possible, whilst making it easy to use. </p>
